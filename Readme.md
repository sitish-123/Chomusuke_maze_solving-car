This project implements a simple maze-navigating robot using an Arduino board, three IR sensors, and 
a motor driver. It was made by me and my team(Shaswat, Raman, Pratik) The robot can move forward, turn left, and turn right based on the IR sensors' input to 
avoid obstacles and navigate through a maze.

Components:
1)Arduino board
2)3 IR sensors
3)Motor driver (L293D)
4)2 DC motors
5)Connecting wires
6)Breadboard
7)Power supply

Pin Configuration:-
IR Sensors:
Forward IR sensor: Pin 8
Left IR sensor: Pin 12
Right IR sensor: Pin 13

Motor Control:
Right motor control: Pins 2 and 3
Left motor control: Pins 4 and 5
Motor Driver Enable Pins
Right motor PWM control: Pin 10
Left motor PWM control: Pin 9
